### Vote | See | Decide


#### Vote!

Vote for your managers and team leaders based on a number of criteria. We use an aggregate of collaborative mindshare to score leaders based on your votes in omni-channel criteria.

#### See!
Using our matrix of integrated users and synergistic data, you can see the stats on managers as part of their profile.

#### Decide!
Using our hyperpersonal system, you can make organic decisions on how to grow synergistic platforms and decide on your next career move.

Are they worth it?
